Software Developer,Escape,"I developed a social media application that empowered users to seamlessly share their schedules, create engaging posts, and meticulously plan out events. Users could effortlessly create and share their schedules, enabling streamlined coordination with friends and colleagues. The post creation feature provided a creative outlet while facilitating engagement through likes, comments, and shares. Moreover, the event planning functionality facilitated the organization of gatherings and meet-ups, allowing users to set event details, send invitations, and efficiently manage RSVPs.[newline]For the frontend development of the application, I used Dart in conjunction with the Flutter framework. Flutter is a versatile open-source framework that allowed the creation of a consistent user interface across both Android and iOS platforms. Its invaluable 'hot-reload' feature streamlined development, enabling rapid iterations and testing. To manage the complex application state, I opted for Flutter Riverpod, a state management library that enhanced data handling, maintained application-wide consistency, and upheld a reliable user experience.[newline]On the backend, I used AWS AppSync, a managed GraphQL API service. Velocity Template Language (VTL) was employed to develop the mapping templates. JavaScript-based AWS Lambda functions handled server-side logic, performing tasks like processing user-generated content, sending notifications, and transforming data.[newline]AWS DynamoDB was used as the database. As a NoSQL database service, DynamoDB excelled in delivering high-throughput and low-latency data access. The schema allowed the efficient storage of user profiles, posts, schedules, events, and related data. DynamoDB's seamless integration with AWS AppSync ensured data retrieval and storage were highly optimized and synchronized with the GraphQL API.",Jun - Aug 2023,Escape.png,https://www.esc-ape.ca/
Computer Vision Engineer,Autogenbot LLP,"I designed and implemented a robot computer vision program using Python, which significantly enhanced the accuracy of yield estimation in agricultural fields. The program employed advanced techniques to detect, count, and diagnose various fruits, resulting in a remarkable 20% improvement compared to traditional area-based estimation methods.[newline]To achieve precise object detection and classification, I initially implemented the YOLOv3 model and later upgraded to YOLOv5. The model demonstrated outstanding performance with a precision of 86.3% and a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 86.5%. This ensured highly reliable identification of different fruits in the field.[newline]To extend the applicability of the program, I conducted extensive testing on different hardware platforms, starting with a Raspberry Pi and later transitioning to a Snapdragon 845 based robot. The optimization efforts focused on reducing CPU usage, resulting in a notable 40% increase in frame rate and a 5Â°C decrease in CPU temperature. This enhanced efficiency allowed the robot to operate more effectively in various environmental conditions.",May - Aug 2023,AIRbots.png,https://air-bots.in/
