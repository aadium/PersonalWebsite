Vice President - Public Relations,Indian Club Gaveliers Qatar,"As the Vice President - Public Relations of the club, my primary goal was to increase awareness of the club and its activities to the outside world, as well as motivate members and non-members to attend our meetings and events.[newline]To achieve this, I undertook several initiatives, including the development of the club's first website in December 2018.

Volunteer,"Indian Community Benevolent Forum, Qatar","I joined the Indian Community Benevolent Forum (ICBF) as a volunteer to support and contribute to their noble cause of providing healthcare services to the underprivileged sections of the community. Additionally, I wanted to gain experience as a team member by working with other volunteers towards a common goal. Moreover, I wanted to develop skills in independently managing tasks assigned to me.[newline]As a volunteer, I supported the registration process of patients for various health camps organized by the ICBF. This involved working with the ICBF team to collect patient information, including their medical history and current health concerns. I was responsible for verifying the accuracy of the information provided and making sure that all necessary details were recorded.[newline]Once the registration process was completed, I analyzed the patient's requirements and managed their appointments with relevant doctors or laboratories. This required me to coordinate with different medical service providers and ensure that patients received the necessary care in a timely manner. I also ensured that the patients were informed about their appointments and any other important details related to their healthcare needs.",icbf.png
