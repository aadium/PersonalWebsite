"Booking App","Flutter + Firebase mobile app","Developing a mobile and web application that manages a community hallâ€™s bookings.[newline]Utilized Flutter, a multi-platform development framework, ensuring a consistent user experience across platforms, and an access to a diverse widget library.[newline]Made use of Cloud Firestore for the backend infrastructure, providing scalability, real-time synchronization, and adaptability to evolving data needs in the ongoing development of the booking application.","https://github.com/aadium/booking-app","../images/projects/booking_app.png","booking_app",View Code
"Employee Management System","Thymeleaf + Spring Boot Web App","Engineered a fully functional Employee Management System using the Spring Boot framework for backend development and Thymeleaf templates for frontend rendering. Employed Spring Data JPA to ensure seamless communication with the underlying relational database.[newline]Integrated Bootstrap, a popular CSS framework, to enhance the visual appeal and create an intuitive and user-friendly interface, improving overall user experience.[newline]Established comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to interact with the database seamlessly, which ensured efficient data retrieval, storage, and management by incorporating Spring Data JPA, providing a robust foundation for managing employee records.","https://github.com/aadium/employee-management-system","../images/projects/ems.png","ems",View Code
"To-Do Web Application","React JS + MySQL Web App","Architected and implemented a high-performance CRUD application utilizing ReactJS, Express.js, and Node.js, enabling seamless management of a to-do-list.[newline]Utilized a locally hosted MySQL instance for data storage due to high connection speed, comparatively higher level of security, and the presence of a rigid schema. All this led to loading times of under 300 milliseconds.","https://github.com/aadium/to-do-list","../images/projects/to_do_list.png","to_do_list",View Code
"Temperature and Humidity Monitoring","Python + AWS + Grafana IoT Application","Developed an IoT application that uploaded the simulated temperature and humidity data to the InfluxDB 2.0 database stored on an AWS EC2 instance.[newline]Used Python to simulate and upload the data.[newline]On the EC2 instance, wrote a shell script that would run all the python scripts for data simulaton and upload. Also used a cron job to run the shell script after a given time interval to automate the data upload.[newline]Installed Grafana on the EC2 instance and created a dashboard to visualize the data.","https://github.com/aadium/temp-humidity-iot-project","../images/projects/temp_hum.png","temp_hum",View Code
"Parking Management System","Python Application","Developed an application that manages the entry and exit of vehicles from a parking lot.[newline]Used Tkinter to develop the GUIs that accepts user input. Developed 2 GUIs, one for the entry gate, and one for the exit gate.[newline]The application accomodates vehicles of 3 types: 2-wheelers, 4-wheelers, and trucks. Each one of these has different daily, weekly, and monthly charges. The parkings for each of these types are separate, and some of these are also reserved for handicapped drivers.[newline]While entering, the number plate is recorded using an object detection model. The user has the ability to correct this.[newline]The system automatically assigns a parking to the user based on the vehicle type and the occupied parkings.[newline]While exiting, the bill can be paid by cash, card, or by UPI.[newline]Used MySQL for storing user data, and vacant parkings.","https://github.com/aadium/parking-system","../images/projects/parking.png","parking",View Code
"Wheelchair Exercise Tracker","Product Development Group Project","Designed a solution that enabled wheelchair users to receive an improved quality of exercise.[newline]The design process was grounded in various aspects of biomedical design, starting from problem identification to prototype presentation. Utilized a range of technical skills, including SolidWorks and C++, which were used for making the prototype design and data encryption, respectively. In addition, machine shop skills were utilized for the fabrication of the prototype.[newline]Also used MS Office for the presentations and reports, which helped to effectively communicate the design and its features. As part of the design process, I created a visual abstract using Canva, which effectively communicated the project's key features in a visually appealing way.","../documents/WhPrR.pdf","../images/projects/wheelchair.png","wheelchair",View Report
"B-Mode","C++ Imaging Project","Developed a C++ code to generate a 2D image using input data from an ultrasound scanner.[newline]Applied several programming concepts such as classes, functions, and linked lists. Object-oriented programming (OOP) was utilized in the design and implementation of the code.[newline]Engaged in multiple iterations of testing and debugging to guarantee that the code was error-free and producing the desired output. The final results were satisfying and aligned with the project objectives.","https://github.com/aadium/B-Mode-Beamforming","../images/projects/bmode.png","bmode",View Code
