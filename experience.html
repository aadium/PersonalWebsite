                          <li>As the Vice President - Public Relations of the club, my primary goal was to increase awareness of the club and its activities to the outside world, as well as motivate members and non-members to attend our meetings and events.</li>
                          <li>To achieve this, I undertook several initiatives, including the development of the club's first website in December 2018. The website was designed to showcase the club's activities, achievements, and upcoming events, with the aim of providing information to potential members and visitors.</li>
                          <li>In addition to the website, I also designed eye-catching flyers that were used to publicize the club's meetings and events. These flyers were distributed both online and in physical form to various locations within the community.</li>
                          <li>My efforts to promote the club's activities and events led to an increase in attendance at our meetings and events. I also pursued personal development within the field of public speaking and communication, and as a result, I was certified as a Competent Communicator by Toastmasters International in 2022.</li>
                          <li>Overall, serving as the Vice President - Public Relations of the club was a fulfilling experience that allowed me to utilize my skills and interests in communication and web development to promote a cause that I was passionate about. The experience also taught me the importance of effective communication and marketing in promoting an organization and its activities.</li>

                  <ul>
                    <li>I joined the Indian Community Benevolent Forum (ICBF) as a volunteer to support and contribute to their noble cause of providing healthcare services to the underprivileged sections of the community. Additionally, I wanted to gain experience as a team member by working with other volunteers towards a common goal. Moreover, I wanted to develop skills in independently managing tasks assigned to me.</li>
                    <li>As a volunteer, I supported the registration process of patients for various health camps organized by the ICBF. This involved working with the ICBF team to collect patient information, including their medical history and current health concerns. I was responsible for verifying the accuracy of the information provided and making sure that all necessary details were recorded.</li>
                    <li>Once the registration process was completed, I analyzed the patient's requirements and managed their appointments with relevant doctors or laboratories. This required me to coordinate with different medical service providers and ensure that patients received the necessary care in a timely manner. I also ensured that the patients were informed about their appointments and any other important details related to their healthcare needs.</li>
                    <li>Overall, volunteering with the ICBF helped me develop various skills, including teamwork, communication, and task management. It was a great opportunity to give back to the community and learn valuable life lessons along the way.</li>

                <ul>
                  <li>As a resident of a housing community, I took the initiative to plan and execute fundraising events to raise money for the support staff who worked tirelessly to keep the community clean and well-maintained. The objective of the initiative was three-fold: to express our gratitude to the support staff for their hard work, to motivate residents to contribute towards a good cause, and to motivate the support staff to continue to do their best.</li>
                  <li>To achieve these objectives, I planned and organized various fundraising events such as bake sales, garage sales, raffles, and donation drives. These events were promoted to the residents through flyers and social media platforms. I also reached out to local businesses for sponsorships and donations.</li>
                  <li>Over the years, the fundraising events were successful in raising an average of 5300 Qatar Riyals (2000 Canadian Dollars). The funds raised were used to provide monetary rewards to the support staff as a token of appreciation for their hard work and dedication.</li>
                  <li>This initiative not only helped to strengthen the sense of community and camaraderie within the housing community, but also provided a positive impact on the morale of the support staff who felt valued and appreciated for their work.</li>
